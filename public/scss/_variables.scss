// Tools stylesheets.

// These stylesheets include all project global variables.
// They should not generate any CSS, but provide a set of variables referenced by the rest of the boilerplate.
// All variables set at this level should be prefixed with 'g-' for global. This allows them to be easily distinguished from component specific variables.
// NB: while not strictly speaking variables, for ease of access, font face declarations have also been included here.
